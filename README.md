## Project Info
This pile of heap, *ahem*, I mean, project, is the result of a coffee, Red Bull, and Monter fueled night of coding. We use a django server to make a RESTful API and communicate with a small SQLite database. We also created an algorithm that prioritises each issue so that the most severe/expensive issue will appear near the top of the list in the admin console. As for inputing data, there is an android app that makes it easy to share a recently found issue/problem problems that need fixing all over the county.

## File info
